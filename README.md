#GoodChat

##Background

In the ever-changing, high-speed world of tech, clients are constantly demanding faster, more lightweight apps that can handle high volumes of server requests without error. Enter GoodChat, an agile, lightning fast communication tool built using one of the most exciting programming languages currently out there, Go. Go programming language is an open-source language with small runtime, simple framework, and concurrency primitives that allow for advanced, concurrent multi-thread handling. Goodchat will support concurrent readers and writers with the use of a WebSockets package developed for Go, and can optimize efficiency even under high load. Furthermore, GoodChat will provide a pleasant, intuitive user interface built on React.js. While there are several examples of Go chat applications currently out there, very few, if any, come with a browser-supported user interface. Goodchat will make it easy for users to access the power of Go, without having to load and run programs locally from their command line.
